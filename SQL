DELETE(DML)

Used to delete the tuples(row) of the table and have facility to DELETE ONE OR MULTIPLE ROW USING WHERE CLAUSE

delete EX ->

 delete from emp ; it will delete all the row of table

 delete from emp where id = 2; it will delete one row

----------------------Drop(DDL)-------------------

This command will delete the whole structure of table with data so that's why it is very important or crucial command and the access is to this command is only to database administrator (DBA)

dropEX -> DROP EMP1;

it will vanish whole table with structure

-------------------TRUNCATE(DDL)----------------

Used to delete all rows (tuple) of the table. truncate EX -> TRUNCATE EMP1;

----------------------QUESTIONS-------------------

Question 1: IF WE CAN DELETE ALL ROWS FROM BOTH 'DELETE' COMMAND AND 'TRUNCATE' COMMAND THEN WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

DELETE AND TRUNCATE DIFFERENCE

DELETE command is DML command and TRUNCATE is DDL
TRUNCTE command will delete all rows because we can not use where clause with truncate but WHERE clause can be applied to DELETE command and can delete one or more rows through where condition
Question 2: WHY TRUNCATE IS DDL ALTHOUGH IT IS WORKING ON DATA AND DELETE IS DML IT IS ALSO WORKING ON DATA?

ANSWER:

 When TRUNCATE Command deletes all the row then we can never ROLLBACK our deleted data because in truncate COMMIT is called implicitly

 But in the case of delete the log(backend file) is created from where you can get your data ROLLBACK if deleted by mistake

 REMEMBER: In DELETE case ROLLBACK can be done only before the COMMIT


//sql query to find city names whose starting and ending letters are vowels
SELECT stu_name 
FROM student 
WHERE stu_name LIKE '[aeiouAEIOU]%[aeiouAEIOU]'


//Difference between GroupBy and Having?
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 75000;

Difference between Unique and Primary?
Feature              PRIMARY KEY                                                                  DEFAULT
Purpose            Uniquely identifies records and enforces data integrity.        Provides an automatic value when none is specified during insertion.
Uniqueness          Enforces uniqueness for the column(s) it's applied to.          Does not enforce uniqueness; multiple rows can have the same default value.
NULL Values        Cannot contain NULL values.                                     Can contain NULL values if a default is not set, or if the default is NULL.
Number per Table      Only one per table.                                        Multiple columns can have default values.
Relationship        Used to establish relationships between tables (foreign keys).  Does not directly relate to table relationships.

//Find 3rd highest salary
SELECT MAX(salary) AS third_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary < (
        SELECT MAX(salary)
        FROM employees
    )
);

OR
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
